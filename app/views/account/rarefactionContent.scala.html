        This interactive plot shows rarefaction curves for all samples, i.e. sample diversity (number of unique clonotypes) that is observed under a given sampling depth (number of reads).
        Interpolation (solid line) and extrapolation (dashed lines) are performed using multinomial model. Extrapolation is performed up to the size of largest sample.
        Tool tip displays the observed sample diversity.
