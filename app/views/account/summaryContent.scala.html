    This table holds some basic statistics for all uploaded samples, including:
    Number and frequency of non-coding clonotypes - clonotypes characterized by sequences that contain stop codon or frameshift
    Mean insert size - mean number of nucleotides inserted in V-D and D-J junctions for TRB, IGH, etc or V-J junction for TRA, IGL, etc
    Mean N(D)N size - mean number of nucleotides between V segment end and J segment start.
    Convergence - mean number of CDR3 nucleotide sequences coding for the same CDR3 amino acid sequence.
