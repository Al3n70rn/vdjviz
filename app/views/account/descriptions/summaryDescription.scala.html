<p>The table below holds some basic statistics for all currently uploaded samples, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Number and frequency of non-coding clonotypes - clonotypes characterized by sequences that contain stop codon or frameshift</li>
    <li>Mean insert size - mean number of nucleotides inserted in V-D and D-J junctions for TRB, IGH, etc or V-J junction for TRA, IGL, etc</li>
    <li>Mean N(D)N size - mean number of nucleotides between V segment end and J segment start.</li>
    <li>Convergence - mean number of CDR3 nucleotide sequences coding for the same CDR3 amino acid sequence.</li>
</ul>
