<p>The table below holds some basic statistics for all currently uploaded samples, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Number and frequency of non-coding (NC) clonotypes - clonotypes having a stop codon or a frameshift in their sequence.</li>
    <li>Mean insert size - mean number of nucleotides inserted in V-D and D-J junctions for TRB, IGH, etc or V-J junction for TRA, IGL, etc.</li>
    <li>Mean N(D)N size - mean number of nucleotides between V segment end and J segment start.</li>
    <li>Convergence - mean number of CDR3 nucleotide sequences coding for the same CDR3 amino acid sequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that insert and N(D)N size statistics are only meaningful in case uploaded sample contains V-(D)-J markup information.</p>
