<p>This plot shows a chord diagram of Variable-Joining (V-J) segments combination frequencies.</p>
<p>Each chord represents a set of clonotypes with a given V-J junction and is scaled according to the frequency of reads with such junction.</p>
<p>Each arc represents a V or J segment and is scaled to the relative number of reads that containing the corresponding segment.</p>
<p>Hover any sector to show only relevant V-J pairings.</p>
