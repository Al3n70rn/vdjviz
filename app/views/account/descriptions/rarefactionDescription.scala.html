<p>This interactive plot shows rarefaction curves for all currently uploaded samples, i.e. sample diversity (number of unique clonotypes) that is observed under a given sampling depth (number of reads).</p>
<p><b>Interpolation</b> (solid line) and <b>extrapolation</b>
    (dashed lines) are performed using multinomial model. All samples are extrapolated up to the size of largest sample.</p>
<p>Tooltip displays the observed sample diversity at a given sample size.</p>
